# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that bridges Cursor AI IDE with Figma. Three components communicate in a pipeline:

```
Cursor AI ←(stdio)→ MCP Server ←(WebSocket)→ WebSocket Relay ←(WebSocket)→ Figma Plugin
```

## Build & Development Commands

```bash
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun run build            # Build MCP server (tsup → dist/)
bun run dev              # Build in watch mode
bun socket               # Start WebSocket relay server (port 3055)
bun run start            # Run built MCP server
bun setup                # Full setup (install + configure .cursor/mcp.json)
```

There is no test suite or linter configured.

## Architecture

### MCP Server (`src/talk_to_figma_mcp/server.ts`)
The main server implementing the MCP protocol via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Exposes 50+ tools (create shapes, modify text, manage layouts, export images, etc.) and several AI prompts (design strategies). Communicates with Cursor over stdio and with the WebSocket relay via `ws`. Each request gets a UUID, is tracked in a `pendingRequests` Map with timeout/promise callbacks, and resolves when the plugin responds.

### WebSocket Relay (`src/socket.ts`)
Lightweight Bun WebSocket server on port 3055 (configurable via `PORT` env). Routes messages between MCP server and Figma plugin using channel-based isolation. Clients call `join` to enter a channel; messages broadcast only within the same channel.

### Figma Plugin (`src/cursor_mcp_plugin/`)
Runs inside Figma. `code.js` is the plugin main thread handling 30+ commands via a dispatcher. `ui.html` is the plugin UI for WebSocket connection management. `manifest.json` declares permissions (dynamic-page access, localhost network). The plugin is **not built/bundled** — `code.js` is written directly as the runtime artifact.

## Key Patterns

- **Colors**: Figma uses RGBA 0-1 range. The MCP tools accept 0-1 floats and the filter converts to hex for display.
- **Logging**: All logs go to stderr. Stdout is reserved for MCP protocol messages.
- **Timeouts**: 30s default per command. Progress updates from the plugin reset the inactivity timer.
- **Chunking**: Large operations (scanning 100+ nodes) are chunked with progress updates to prevent Figma UI freezing.
- **Reconnection**: WebSocket auto-reconnects after 2 seconds on disconnect.
- **Zod validation**: All tool parameters are validated with Zod schemas.

## Local Development Setup

1. `bun socket` in one terminal (WebSocket relay)
2. In Figma: Plugins → Development → Link existing plugin → select `src/cursor_mcp_plugin/manifest.json`
3. Configure `.cursor/mcp.json` to point to local `src/talk_to_figma_mcp/server.ts`
4. Run plugin in Figma, join a channel, then use tools from Cursor
